                <dt>How do I connect with other attendees before the conference?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We provide a private Slack workspace for registered attendees where you can introduce yourself, find people in your industry, and plan meetups. Access details will be sent to your registration email one week before the conference.

                <dt>Can I schedule one-on-one meetings with speakers?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Many speakers have designated office hours during the conference. Check the conference app or website for speaker availability. You can also request to meet speakers through the app, and we'll help facilitate introductions based on availability.

                <dt>Are there any social events in the evenings?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes! Beyond formal events, many attendees organize informal meetups and social activities. The conference app has a community board where you can find or organize these events. Local restaurants and bars near the venue are popular gathering spots.
